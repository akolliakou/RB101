# A triangle is classified as follows:

# right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
# acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
# obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, 
# nd all angles must be greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not 
# satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and 
# returns a symbol :right, :acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether 
# he triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid triangle.

# You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about 
# floating point errors. You may also assume that the arguments are specified 
# in degrees.
